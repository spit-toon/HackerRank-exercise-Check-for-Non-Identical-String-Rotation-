So this is my solution to a challenge on hackerRank: “Check for Non-Identical String Rotation”.

So if you do not want the answer, do not look at this…
If you copy and pasted this code it will not work properly, because the answer is committed out at the top of the code…

Underneath that; is the code I wrote, and when run in a terminal. Produces if the test passes or if they do not (fail), and what was tested, how it was tested; the expected output, and the actual output.
